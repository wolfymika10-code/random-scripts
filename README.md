# random-scripts
A small repository that holds some cool scripts, made by me.

### How do I use these?
Under all of these questions is documentation for each script.

### Why does it not work?!
My scripts are NOT moible freindly unless stated otherwise (sorry!)

### Do you do anythin' else?
I sometimes make requires that you can pop into your games.
