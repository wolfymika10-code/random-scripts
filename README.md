# random-scripts
A small repository that holds some cool scripts, made by me.

## FaQ

### How do I use these?
Under all of these questions is documentation for each script.
You can either copy the source or use the loadstring() provided.

### Why does it not work, I'm on moible!
My scripts are NOT moible freindly unless stated otherwise (sorry!)

### Do you do anythin' else?
I sometimes make server side requires that you can pop into your games. 

### Why can't I see any UI?!
Most of my scripts dont use Gui, check documentation to see the keybinds.

### I got a problem with my script.
Post it in the Issues thing and I'll try to get it fixed ASAP. <sub>As a reminder, it's just me working on it! + I'm a novice programmer after all</sub>
